The idea behind the application is to tackle a problem that is very common in Pakistan and many other countries of the world.
Problem: Due to illetracy in most of the parts of the country and un awareness of proper measures of medication, people face a lot 
of problems during any medical treatment. One of the motivation behind the app is that due to rapid increase in data we need computers
and storage to make the day to day process more efficent so me and my team decided to introduce a solution to this problem.
Solution: We decided to store all the medical record of the patients on a usb card, which is very easily available and cheap. The idea is
that all the information about the patient is stored in the card and is kept with the patient and whenevr the patient needs medication he/she
goes to the doctor and gives the card to the doctor and explain what is wrong, the doctor than by going through all the previsou records of patient
the medication he had, allergies, medicines etc. Can make the best decision for the patient and add the data to the profile of the user.
The data is kept safe with both the patient and the doctor. So the patient needs to have no information about the card all he has to do is to
keep the card safe and the rest would be done by the doctor.
